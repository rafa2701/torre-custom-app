9am-?

Thanks to a huge power outage in my zone, and other issues, i couldnt really log any real time on the app, just figuring out what to do and how to do it, finally coming up with the idea of doing a minimalistic clone of the torre genoma, where, or sort of "torre  searcher" where after user imput and choose between user or job, it can show a brief info about the users and even show a small profile page and sort jobs and small brief of details about them, using the api provided and rendered in react.
